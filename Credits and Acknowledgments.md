## Core Methodologies

### VerifiMind-PEAS

The ethical and security validation framework at the heart of RoleNote AI is a direct implementation of the **VerifiMind-PEAS** methodology. The X-Z-CS RefleXion Trinity ensures that all AI-driven suggestions are innovative, ethical, and secure.

### GODELAI

The philosophical principles of wisdom preservation and dynamic alignment are inspired by the **GODELAI** project. The C-S-P (Compression → State → Propagation) framework has guided our architectural design to create a system that not only organizes information but also propagates wisdom.

## Technology Stack

We are grateful to the developers and communities behind the following technologies:

- **Google Gemma:** The open-source small language models from Google that power our on-device reasoning and suggestion capabilities.
- **Sentence Transformers:** The models and library that enable powerful semantic search and context matching.
- **Android & iOS:** The mobile operating systems that provide the foundation for our platform.

## Research

The following research has been influential in the design of RoleNote AI:

- **Motion (usemotion.com):** For demonstrating the power of an all-in-one AI productivity platform.
- **Otter.ai & Fireflies.ai:** For pioneering AI-powered meeting transcription and summarization.
